## Overview

ScreenFlow provides the complete <a href="#">screencasting solution</a> that combines professional <a href="#">screen recording</a> with capable <a href="#">video editing</a> in unified workflow. Rather than recording in one application and editing in another, ScreenFlow handles both seamlessly—capturing screen, camera, audio, and iOS devices, then providing editing tools to polish recordings into professional presentations.

<a href="#">Multi-source recording</a> captures screen activity, webcam video, microphone audio, and system audio simultaneously. All sources record to separate tracks for independent editing, enabling flexible post-production adjustment.

<a href="#">iOS device recording</a> captures connected iPhone and iPad screens for app demos and mobile tutorials. Show mobile content alongside desktop recording for comprehensive demonstrations.

<a href="#">Retina quality capture</a> records at full resolution including HiDPI displays for crisp, clear footage. Screen recordings look sharp at any viewing size without pixelation.

<a href="#">Partial screen capture</a> records selected screen regions rather than entire display. Focus on relevant content without capturing distracting desktop elements.

<a href="#">Timeline editing</a> provides professional video editing interface for assembling and refining recordings. Trim clips, arrange sequences, and build polished videos from raw recordings.

<a href="#">Callouts and annotations</a> highlight important screen elements with zoom, highlight, click effects, and other visual indicators that direct viewer attention. Show what matters in screen activity.
